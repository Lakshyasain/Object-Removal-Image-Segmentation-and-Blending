    "## About The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Unwanted object removal is a common task in many computer vision and image processing systems. \n",
    "One of the most popular techniques for object removal is image inpainting, which involves filling in the missing or damaged portions of a picture with information from the surrounding area. \n",
    "In this project, we provide a method for removing objects from photos that is based on inpainting using two ways and compare the results. \n",
    "We focus on cv2.INPAINT TELEA ,cv2.INPAINT NS and averaging neighbouring pixel, two commonly used OpenCV picture inpainting methods. \n",
    "We discuss the underlying principles of these methods as well as their benefits and drawbacks for eliminating things"

    "## For the average function\n",
    "\n",
    "1.For the average function, When it is run a new window will appear in which select the object you want to create the mask for. \n",
    "2.Click the start point and by seeing the appropriate region draw the rectangle of the blue colour and leave the cursor to the desired end point. \n",
    "3.After it we will see that a new masked image is shown with that area as complete white and remaining black. \n",
    "4.A new window which is final output image will also be displayed which shows the blended image after segmentation. \n",
    "5.Press escape for closing all windows or stop the code to Execute."
